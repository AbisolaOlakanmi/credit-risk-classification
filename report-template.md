## Overview of the Analysis
This dataset is a historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.
The data has about 77536 rows and 8 columns, the rows, reflecting how much people borrowed(loan_size), the interest rate of the loan(interest_rate), income of the borrower(borrower_income), number of accounts been held by these borrowers, derogatory_marks, total_debt, and their loan status (loan_status). Thus, value of 0 in the “loan_status” column means that the loan is healthy. And value of 1 means that the loan has a high risk of defaulting
The value_counts function reveals, approximately 3.23% (2,500) are non-performing loans, out of the 77,356 loans from the raw data




## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
